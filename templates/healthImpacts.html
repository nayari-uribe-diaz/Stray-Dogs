		Pregnancy affects street dogs more than one might think. There is a 50% higher death rate in female street dogs than males (Cortez-Aguirre et al.). This lower life expectancy is primarily
		caused by neonatal and postpartum problems for the dog. Overbreeding is another reason for overpopulation of dogs. Although overbreeding is one of the leading factors of the population of street dogs, 
		most dogs that live on the streets don’t make it to the age of reproduction. The reasons for this is due to the poor living conditions of the dog, unhealthy habitat, mistreatment, and poor nutrition, and illness (Mota-Rojas et al.). 
		Illnesses are a huge issue in the topic of street dogs. Most illnesses do not only affect the dogs, but can be transmitted to humans as well. Diseases such as rabies, leptospirosis, mycosis, and lymes disease. 
		Stray dogs are transmitters of viral, gastrointestinal, dermatological and respiratory infections, among others (Ayala-Rodríguez et al. 2)  These diseases can be spread by many ways including a bite, lick, or contact
		with their feces. Routine vet checkups are a good way to prevent a dog from getting such diseases. They help stop oncoming diseases before they get severe, benefitting both the dog and the owner. 
		This small change could vastly change the life of many street dogs, who are abandoned and eventually die because of their diseases.
