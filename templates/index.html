		<h1>The Problem with Dog Ovepopulation in Mexico</h1>
    <p>
		It is estimated that there are about 18 million dogs in Mexico. However, almost 70% of these dogs are living on the streets. These statistics increase by 20% every year (Escareño Sánchez et al. 8). 
		The reasons for this level of overpopulation vary, the most common cause being abandonment. These dogs being on the street causes a plethora of safety, noise, and health problems, not only for humans, but for the dogs themselves too. 
		Stray dogs can cause lots of disturbances including loud barking at night, attacks on people, and creating a mess. In this paper I will be discussing the effects of street dog overpopulation in Mexico, how they affect the place and people around them, 
		and offering some possible solutions to help minimize the amount of dogs roaming the streets.
    </p>
		<h2 class="headings">Main Causes</h2>
	<p>
		Abandonment by their owners is one of the main reasons dogs end up on the streets. 
		Mexico holds the #1 spot for dog abandonment in Latin America. Reasons for abandonment vary. 
		The president of the Pro-Animal Association reported that the animal abandonment rate increased from 30% to 70% during the pandemic (Ayala Rodriguez et al. 2). 
		It is estimated that the main reasons dogs get abandoned are: Lack of time and patience, reproduction due to not sterilizing the dog, the owner’s inability to keep up with the dog’s maintenance, and living in a “no-dog” zone. 
		Many rented living spaces such as apartments do not allow dogs or other pets in the building. Despite this, some people still choose to keep pets in secret. 
		Those who are discovered to have kept a pet are ultimately given two options: move out with the pet, or stay but get rid of the pet. Many people choose to get rid of the pet, which most commonly results in the animal living on the streets.
		A significant reason for the abandonment of a dog is inability to afford it. About 9.5% of Mexicans live in extreme poverty (Castagno 11). This is another issue that has yet to be resolved. 
		A study that measured the reasons for abandonment found that aggression made up 83.6% of the reasons. Sickness was 38%, behavioral problems: 20.9%, moving to another home: 13.3%, lack of space, pregnancy, causing problems, nearing death, and old age each made up 3.8% of the list. (Mota-Rojas et al.).
		According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, 500,000 dogs get abandoned every year (Escareño Sanchez et al. 8). However, not all dogs are abandoned without owners. In an interview with Karla Uribe, who grew up in Nayarit, Mexico, I learned that lots of dogs that roam around her hometown have owners. 
		She states that, “Many of the dogs have homes, but their owners never pay attention to them. They are left to roam the streets and pester anyone they come across.” This negligence not only affects the dog but also the community around them.
		<br>   Lack of knowledge on animal care is another main factor of this street dog overpopulation. There are many instances where a person will buy a dog without any prior knowledge on how to take care of one. This makes it very easy for the owner to abandon their dog after unexpected behaviors ensue (Escareño Sanchez 9).
	</p>
		<h2 class="headings">Health Impacts</h2>
	<p>
		Pregnancy affects street dogs more than one might think. There is a 50% higher death rate in female street dogs than males (Cortez-Aguirre et al.). This lower life expectancy is primarily
		caused by neonatal and postpartum problems for the dog. Overbreeding is another reason for overpopulation of dogs. Although overbreeding is one of the leading factors of the population of street dogs, 
		most dogs that live on the streets don’t make it to the age of reproduction. The reasons for this is due to the poor living conditions of the dog, unhealthy habitat, mistreatment, and poor nutrition, and illness (Mota-Rojas et al.). 
		Illnesses are a huge issue in the topic of street dogs. Most illnesses do not only affect the dogs, but can be transmitted to humans as well. Diseases such as rabies, leptospirosis, mycosis, and lymes disease. 
		Stray dogs are transmitters of viral, gastrointestinal, dermatological and respiratory infections, among others (Ayala-Rodríguez et al. 2)  These diseases can be spread by many ways including a bite, lick, or contact
		with their feces. Routine vet checkups are a good way to prevent a dog from getting such diseases. They help stop oncoming diseases before they get severe, benefitting both the dog and the owner. 
		This small change could vastly change the life of many street dogs, who are abandoned and eventually die because of their diseases.
	</p>
		<h2 class="headings">Attacks</h2>
	<p>
		Attacks by street dogs are a big concern for pedestrians in Mexico. Although some dogs may be friendly, or afraid, some dogs can become aggressive. This aggression commonly comes from abusive owners that instilled fear
		into the dog, prompting it to bite and attack. These behaviors follow them onto the streets, becoming a threat to the community and other dogs. Dog attacks are unfortunately common in La Valla, San Juan del Río, Mexico.
		The municipal delegate of La Valla, Jacobo Hernandez Ibarra describes this issue as a consequence of street dog overpopulation (Luna). During the first half of 2023, there were at least fifteen street dog attacks in the 
		area. Many of those fifteen attacks were directed towards minors and elderly people. Although the municipal delegation has counted these fifteen attacks, Jacobo Hernandez Ibarra states that there is a high chance of 
		there being many more dog attacks happening around them, as most cases of dog violence go unreported (Luna). In the interview with Karla Uribe, she narrated her experience with dog attacks. “My aunt got attacked by a
		dog as she was walking along the street. It bit her hand and managed to draw blood; she had to go to the hospital,” she explained, “And when I was about ten walking home after buying tortillas I was suddenly nipped in 
		the angle by a dog. It didn’t draw blood, thankfully, but I was afraid to walk through that street again for fear that I would get bit.” Karla’s first hand experience shows how aggressive dogs on the street disturb the 
		safety of the city. This can be especially threatening to young children who go out to play.
	</p>
		<h2 class="headings">How is the Government Helping?</h2>
	<p>
		   The Mexican government has also been making attempts at fixing the issue. La Ley De Protección A Los Animales Del Distrito Federal (LPDADF) or The Federal District’s Animal Protection Law in Mexico City has many articles
		working against animal cruelty. For example, Article 1 focuses on protecting the animal’s well being. It swears to “protect animals, guaranteeing their well-being, care, good treatment, maintenance, accommodation, 
		their natural development, health and avoiding mistreatment, cruelty, suffering, bestiality and deformation of their physical characteristics; ensuring animal health and public health.” (Castagno 22). Enforcing laws
		such as this one around more states could help promote proper care for dogs.  This could decrease the amount of dog abandonment and the overall population of street dogs around the country.
		<br>   Article 10 of the LPDADF explains how Mexico City’s Health Secretary takes care of supervising, regulating, and verifying animal control centers in the district, while also making sure that euthanasia is performed
		humanely and professionally. The Health Secretary is also in charge of making sure dogs that have been abandoned and living on the streets are captured with permission from the local authorities and delegation of 
		the district and transfer them to control centers or protective associations. (Castagno 16).

		<h2 class="headings">Possible Solutions</h2>
	<p>
		There are many possible solutions in controlling the stray dog population. One of the most common solutions offered by many organizations is sterilization and vaccination campaigns. Sterilization could prove to be a very
		effective method in population control, as it targets the problem before it happens. Luis Manuel Escareño Sanchez describes in his paper how the “capture, sterilize, and return” strategy is recommended for communities 
		who are tolerant of street dogs (12). Sterilization campaigns can prove to be very effective due to the fact that it prevents dogs from breeding and continues to contribute to the overpopulation of street dogs. 
		Vaccination campaigns are also very important, specifically for the safety of people and other dogs.
		<br>   Education on dog maintenance is also a very recommended solution for this problem. Education tackles the issue of 
		abandoning dogs due to ignorance about how to properly care for the dog. If people know what to expect when getting a dog and how to care for it properly, abandonment for things such as inability to keep up with
		maintenance could decrease significantly. Sanchez’ paper also states that Sawbridge signals that the best and most humane method of population control is through the combination of education with identification, 
		while the International Companion Animal Coalition believes that the best method of population control is by using multiple different techniques (13). Other countries such as Denmark, Finland, and Germany have 
		successfully used education as their main form of animal control.
		<br>   Adoption is another potential method for decreasing the street dog population. It could be a good solution as long as the potential owners are
		required to sign an adoption contract agreeing to sterilize the animal, provide identification, and give all the needed vaccines to the pet. Acquiring funding for an adoption center for street dogs could change the
		lives of both a dog and a person. In Escareño Sanchez’ paper, he describes how adoption could be a potential solution that benefits from tourism in the country. Sanchez explains how the existence of programs such as
		adoption and care centers can attract tourists who may be interested in supporting and funding these initiatives (15).
		<br>   Euthanasia may seem like a very controversial topic when it comes to animal population control. 
		In a paper written by Miguel Angel Sanchez Castro, he states that euthanasia is a recommended method in controlling animal populations. He explains how euthanasia should be a method used for animals that are suffering
		from an illness, injury, or ones who have behavioral issues and are a threat to other animals as well as humans (3). As much as euthanasia can be seen as a quick solution to issues like overpopulation, it is not the 
		only solution available for this problem. Article 55 states that it is illegal to use any form of euthanasia on an animal in public, unless it is done by a trained professional. Similarly, euthanasia must only be done 
		by a qualified professional and be done properly (Castagno 33).

		<h2 class="headings">Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		Street dog overpopulation in Mexico has been a problem for many years. Dogs are ending up homeless and on the streets for a plethora of reasons such as abandonment and neglect from irresponsible owners. 
		Dogs living in the street cause a multitude of problems not only for themselves, but for the people in the community and other dogs. As much as it would be easier to simply pick and choose a solution for this problem, 
		I believe that there needs to be many different strategies implemented in order to achieve the goal that is decreasing the homeless dog population and getting dogs off of the streets of Mexico. Supporting causes like 
		Pet Peeves Unmasked and Compassion Without Borders can help get dogs off the streets and into loving homes where they belong.
