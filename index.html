      <h1>The Problem with Dog Ovepopulation in Mexico</h1>
    <p>
     It is estimated that there are about 18 million dogs in Mexico. However, almost 70% of these dogs are living on the streets. These statistics increase by 20% every year (Escareño Sánchez et al. 8). The reasons for this level of overpopulation vary, the most common cause being abandonment. These dogs being on the street causes a plethora of safety, noise, and health problems, not only for humans, but for the dogs themselves too. Stray dogs can cause lots of disturbances including loud barking at night, attacks on people, and creating a mess. In this paper I will be discussing the effects of street dog overpopulation in Mexico, how they affect the place and people around them, and offering some possible solutions to help minimize the amount of dogs roaming the streets.
